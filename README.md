# Theoretical Sorting

A Computer Science researcher claims to have come up with a sorting algorithm
that can sort arbitrary elements in $O(n)$ time based on comparisons of two
elements at a time. This would be asymptotically faster than any known general
sorting algorithm. The algorithm itself is proprietary and will be sold by a
company.

How would you verify this claim? You may assume that you have access to a
black-box implementation of the sorting algorithm, i.e. you cannot examine the
source code, but you can use it to sort any list you like. Explain in detail
your method for investigating whether X is correct, including any expected
results you would get.

Also give a theoretical argument for why X could or could not be correct, based
on the complexity of the general sorting problem we covered in class.

### Verifying X

There are two key aspects that I would want to verify. The first is that it
is in fact a sorting algorithm for arbitrary elements. The other is that it 
is in fact in $O(n)$ time. 

To verify the first claim, I would write some property-based tests. This code would
generate a random list of integers and ensure that for any given list, (and all
of its permutations) the algorithm outputs a sorted list. The key part of this is that
all permutations must be returned sorted because the main concern is that a sorting algorithm
with linear time complexity wouldn't be able to possibly generate all orderings of a list. I 
would also want to verify that this works with other datatypes as well. We don't know how 
elements are being compared, but we know that two elements are being compared at a time. It's
possible that the comparison method wouldn't work as well with datatypes like strings or
a type of object that requires something like a lexicographic ordering that requires attributes
of an object to be compared based on a hierarchy. 

To verify the second claim, I would want to test the time complexity. I would do this in a similar way 
to the sorting comparison lecture. My main goal would be to see if it is asymptotically faster than algorithms 
like quicksort. I do think it would be important to run timing tests, but it is not going to be as good in 
practice when compared to actually being able to see the code. The claim could be correct, but the algorithm 
just uses absurd amounts of memory, and as a result, performs slower in practice than quicksort with the current 
resources we have. If it does perform faster, it still doesn't mean it is linear as it could just be a faster
implementation with the same complexity of $\Theta(n \cdot log(n))$. This tests could still tell us if it is the 
fastest algorithm in practice though. 

### Theoretical Argument

I would find it highly unlikely that X is correct. This is because we know that it sorts "based on comparisons 
of two elements at a time." This makes it a comparison based algorithm. This means that, just like the example
covered in the theoretical bounds lecture, each comparison would have two outcomes, allowing us to represent the 
outcomes as a binary decision tree with the permutations being leaves. Because there are n! possible permutations 
of a given list there are at least n! leaves. A property of a binary tree is that if it has a number of leaves L, it 
has at least a height of $log_2(L) + 1$. This means that the decision tree has a height of at least $log_2(n!) + 1$, 
which is the same as $n \cdot log_2(n) + 1$ according to Sterling's approximation. As each level represents a comparison
in the tree, comparison based sorting algorithms have a lower bound complexity of $\Omega (n \cdot log(n))$. This complexity
represents the best possible algorithm to solve this solution. It would probably be safe to assume that this algorithm is
not better than the best possible solution.
